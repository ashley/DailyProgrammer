"""
You were hired to create words for a new language. However, your boss wants these words to follow a 
strict pattern of consonants and vowels. You are bad at creating words by yourself, so you decide it
would be best to randomly generate them. Your task is to create a program that generates a random word 
given a pattern of consonants (c) and vowels (v).

INPUT
Any string of the letters c and v, uppercase or lowercase.

OUTPUT
A random lowercase string of letters in which consonants (bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz) occupy the given 'c' 
indices and vowels (aeiou) occupy the given 'v' indices.
